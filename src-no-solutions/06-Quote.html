    <blockquote>
      <p>The connection between the language in which we
      think/program and the problems and solutions we can
      imagine is very close. For this reason restricting
      language features with the intent of eliminating
      programmer errors is at best dangerous.</p>
      <p>-- Bjarne Stroustrup</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Mr. Stroustrup is the inventor of the C++
    programming language, but quite an insightful
    person nevertheless.</p>
